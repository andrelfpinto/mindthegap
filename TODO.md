# TODO

- add MINUS
- fix documentation -- relations in ascii are missing and merged like b|B
- add a test: if i1 INTERSECT i2 is defined, then i1 UNION i2 is certainly defined
- add COUNT -- or size to get the cardinality, add it to Domain (Ordinal)
- fix gap -- it has extra points
- canonical - add a method to convert to [) interval
